# ApexRandom
My first web app in HTML and JavaScript!

Outputs a random character and location for each play from an array, since the game doesn't have a built-in randomizer

To use: 
1. Download here: -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HSuoOJxm8IJ8K5EZd3NzrE_1lwdGjplX/view?usp=sharing
2. Open in a web browser. 

Note: It works on android, not sure about apple devices when opening custom HTML files
