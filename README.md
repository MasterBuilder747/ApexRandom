# ApexRandom
My first web app in HTML and JavaScript!

Outputs a random character and location for each play from an array, since the game doesn't have a built-in randomizer

To use: Download the ApexRandom.html file above and open it in a web browser. It also works on android, not sure about apple devices when opening custom HTML files
