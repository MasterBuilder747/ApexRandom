# ApexRandom
My first web app in HTML and JavaScript!

Outputs a random character and location for each play from an array, since the game doesn't have a built-in randomizer

To use: 
1. Download here: -> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18APnBKXP447P8n9FZ-iOQr3_FFx-kdRq?usp=sharing 
2. Open in a web browser. 

Note: It works on android, not sure about apple devices when opening custom HTML files
